 <h1>I don't own you anymore. You do. I don't know if that's a good thing, a bad thing, or nothing at all. It was bound to happen someday though. </h2>
  <h3>Annie is my sister. She's a teenage girl and she lives online just like the rest of them. She's confident, pretty, funny, maybe a little crazy, but she's worked hard to make sure you think that. I wouldn't, but she would.</h2>
    <h3>Briscoe is my best friend from back home. He looks like his photographs, and he wants you to see them. He's very proud of what he sees through his Leica.</h2>
      <h3>Maizie is one of the most unique and impactful people I know. She does everything her own way. She barely texts and I don't think she uses instagram right, but we FaceTime almost everyday. She's always in the moment.</h2>
        <h3>Kendrick has been my roommate for almost a year. I'm closer to him than almost anyone else I know. He'd prefer it if you didn't know he was ever there though, and takes great pride in how little she shows others, but takes a lot of pride in his work.</h2>
          <h3>Jaemin is a friend of mine from Seattle I've only seen in person once. We got to know each other over Instagram. He communicates in memes about rap and how much he misses the gym. He even looks like them now.</h2>
            <h3>The photograph has changed. The purpose of this journal is to find out how.</h2>
              <h3>There are so many more, because now we can't go<a href="index.html">back.</a></h2>
